description = "A flying enemy that flies in different patterns. Can only be killed with strong hits. <br> The lines around it in the editor indicate where it will move to with its <u>default settings</u>. Black outlines represent circular and straight movement, and coloured outlines represent different crescent movements. Also please note that it is recommended to keep the speed settings relatively low, no less than 5, unless using <b>Horizontal and Vertical Continuous movement.</b> <br><br><u>Stationary:</u> Sits in place and hovers up and down. Turns to always face the player. <br><br><u>Vertical and Horizontal Back and Forth:</u> Will fly a set distance before turning back and flying the opposite direction. By default flies about 5 blocks. <br><br><u>Circle (Up and Down):</u> Flies in a circle, for <b>Circle (Up)</b>, setting a positive speed value will make it fly clockwise, and a negative value counter-clockwise. The opposite applies to <b>Circle (Down)</b>. <br><br><u>Horizontal and Vertical Continuous:</u> These make the NPC move in a straight line, either vertically or horizontally. Left, Right, Up, Down and Terminus redirectors all affect its movement. <br><br><u>Crescent Movement:</u> Causes the Zinger NPC to fly in a semi-circle shape.
